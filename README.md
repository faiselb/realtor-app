# Project Description

This app is a full stack server application. The goal of the app is allowing users who are real estate agents to sign up and add communities (or areas) they are working in. After that they can add their listings in these communities for the interested buyers to see. I used React as a front-end framework. Also, MongoDB was used as database and Mongoose was used as middleware.
